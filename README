SlideCAPTCHA
============

CAPTCHAs getting too hard to read, even for a human? SlideCAPTCHA uses a slightly different approach, using an image with easily-read text, but one caveat for OCRs: the human must move a slider to line the text up properly. Humans can do this easily, but OCRs must transform the image and attempt text recognition multiple times.


Example
=======

Include SlideCAPTCHA in your form with the following code:

<%= slide_captcha_tags %>

Verify responses by calling the following in your controller:

verify_slide_captcha(options)

True if verified, false if the response is incorrect. Optional available options are
:model		=> A model to attach errors to, probably the main subject of your form.
:message	=> A custom error message.

Example usage:

if verify_slide_captcha(:model => @user, :message => "Robot test failed") then @user.save

SlideCAPTCHA uses the prototype and scriptaculous javascript libraries for the slider effects. These libraries are included with Rails by default can be included in a page as follows:

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

Scriptaculous slider effects may not be available with all versions of Rails. If this is the case with you copy slider.js from the plugin's public/javascripts to your public/javascripts directory.
